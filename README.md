# GossipChatter
Prints the gossip / quest text in chat as if an NPC were speaking in /say. No real options for now, just purely prints gossip / quest text in chat. If I find more "frames with text" stuff I'll probably add more to this. This also grabs books & their associate page number and prints the item text into the chat in the form of an emote.
