# GossipChatter
<p>A small addon that copies the Gossip / Quest / Book Item text into the chat frame and displays it as though an NPC were speaking in /say.</p>
<p>Much of the time, players skip over quest text, dialog, or book items and not even read them. Gossip Text altogether is disabled by default. Rather than forcing it to be enabled for everyone, this addon will grab the text while still printing the text into chat. Other addons for enabling gossip text frame like <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/npc-rp-gossip">NPC RP Gossip Text Re-enabler</a> are there for you - and GossipChatter is fully compatible with NPCRPGossip.</p>
<p>There aren't really any options that come with this yet as it's a fairly simple function. So far this covers: Gossip dialogs, Quests / Quest Turnins / Quest Progress, and Book items found across the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Gossip Chatter now also supports Text to Speech</h3>
<p>For additional voice chat options you can visit the <a href="https://support.blizzard.com/article/000288679">Blizzard Support Page</a></p>
<p>New options have been added for text to speech, including choosing voice options per target gender, adjusting the rate and volume for each voice, and an auto-play speech feature complete with a toggleable button and option to interrupt queued messages.</p>
